	 <h2> Basketball </h2>
	 <p>One thing that is really important in my life is Basketball.</p> 
	 <p>One personall acomplishment that I received was I got 3rd place in a state basketball competition. Another acomplishment is how much growth I have seen since I first started.</p> 
	 <img src="images/TonyParker9.jpg" alt="Parker" width="200" height="200">
	 <p> This is Tony Parker. He is the person that I look up to as a basketball player. I love his style of play and his leadership on his team. He has won many championships and is one of the most accomplished basketball player ever.</p>
	 <p>When I was younger I loved basketball and I wanted to play it all the time. After I started to feel forced into playing basketball and I lost my motivation to get better. Later I regained my love for basketball and got better and started to compete in state wide fun shots. Now I continue to grow and get better every time I play.</p>
	 <p> Who: My idol is Tony parker. What: One of my favorite things about basketball is the variety of shoes. When: I started when I was 4 years old. Where: I love to watch basketball and the Jazz's court. Why:Because it is the thing that I love most. How: Practice all the time and try to do better in everything that we do.</p>
  	 <p> One peice of insight that i have learned is to only compare yourself to others to become a better player. Don't compare to other people when it will put you down. Only compare to learn something new to add to your game.</p>
